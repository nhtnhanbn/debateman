# DebateMan Timers

Simple timers for Australasian 3v3 debates. No separate timers for reply speeches, but you can just reset the speaking times and reuse timers.

By [Nhan](https://nhtnhanbn.github.io), reachable by [email](mailto:nhtnhanbn@gmail.com). No cost, no guarantees.

## Use online

[nhtnhanbn.github.io/debateman/timers/](https://nhtnhanbn.github.io/debateman/timers/)

## Use offline

### Method 0: precache

Visit [nhtnhanbn.github.io/debateman/timers/](https://nhtnhanbn.github.io/debateman/timers/) and preload the page. The timers can then be used even if the device goes offline. Test beforehand!

Note that clearing the browser cache can affect offline capability.

### Method 1: download raw (some devices)

Download [Foot 2.m4a](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhtnhanbn/debateman/main/timers/Foot%202.m4a), [timers.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhtnhanbn/debateman/main/timers/timers.css), [timers.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhtnhanbn/debateman/main/timers/timers.html), and [timers.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhtnhanbn/debateman/main/timers/timers.js). Ensure that these files are all stored in the same folder and have unchanged names. The timers can then be used by opening timers.html in a browser.

### Method 2: install PWA (most devices)

Visit [nhtnhanbn.github.io/debateman/timers/](https://nhtnhanbn.github.io/debateman/timers/). Find and select "Install", "Add to Home screen" or similar (this may take a short while to become available). The timers can then be used by opening the app installed to the device.

Your particular browser may or may not support installation. [Device-specific instructions](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/installation/#desktop-installation)

Untested on iOS/iPadOS. Note that clearing the browser cache can affect offline capability.
